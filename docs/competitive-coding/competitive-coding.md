# Competitive Coding


*__Think fast. Think right!__*

I'm getting back to Competitive Coding. I loved those days when I could sit and solve multiple problem in one go, it was awesome. It's been a while since I left this path, but I'm returning to it.

I don't think I'm a hardcore problem-solver, but I do love the idea of solving problems. I won't focus on all of the platforms!
