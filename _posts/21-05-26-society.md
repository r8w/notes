# Society

*We don't live in society; we survive in it.*

During the initial days, I used to think that improving the education system would eradicate society's ample amount of issues. As I grew up, my thoughts changed, and it's still shifting. The narrative doesn't remain the same. It has to change. A palace built on a swamp has to sink if we care about strengthening only one of its pillars and ignoring the rest.

Now, I consider education one of the pillars of society. It standalone can't help an individual or a group of individuals to grow and flourish. I have no faith in idealism, but before we fix the pillars, we've to strengthen the foundation, too. With correct strategies, we can make progress on both sides of this massive infrastructure called humans.

So, what exactly is the foundation?

If we look closely, we'll be able to see how disrupted society is. Lack of education isn't the only reason for all sorts of chaos, correct? Education doesn't teach you ethics. It's something that you learn either from your surroundings or by your observations which could be different from what you're seeing. I'm not saying education doesn't establish an impact. It does, a lot, but I feel like, on the other side, it isn't the only way to promote ethics. An ethical mind will grasp the teachings in a better way.

Now, how do we promote ethics before we send young minds to learn and understand the complexity?

When we keep education in perspective, everything gets pivoted either you're sending children to school or throw lights on people who disagree with your narrative.

"He needs to be educated."

No one tries to dig deep into this topic, and I find it surprising. It seems like the whole point gets stuck in this hole of "right knowledge", which is always subjective. Maybe you need to be educated? Or maybe everyone? Now, everything has shifted from one point to another. Instantly, education is about maturity, too.
