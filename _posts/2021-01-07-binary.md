- Binary number is a number expressed in the __base-2 numeral system__.
- Uses two symbols __0s__ and __1s__.
- The base-2 numeral system is a positional notation with a radix of 2.
- Each digit is referred to as a __bit__.

__Understanding__

*Decimal Counting*

- Uses 10 digits from *0 to 9*
- Counting begins from the rightmost side, also called the *first digit*.
- When the rightmost side gets equal to the highest digit, i.e __9__
    - The initial value is set to zero
    - The value available left to the initial value is incremented by 1.

```
000, 001, 002, 003, 004, 005
006, 007, 008, 009, 010, 011
```

__*Binary Counting*__

In Binary, after a digit reaches to 1, an increment resets it to 0 but causes increment of the next digit to the left.

```
000, 001, 010, 011, 100
```

In binary system, each digit is represented in the form of $$ 2^n $$ where $$ n $$ is the index of the digit.

*For example:*

- $$ 100101_2 $$ is - $$ [ ( 1 ) × 2^5 ] + [ ( 0 ) × 2^4 ] + [ ( 0 ) × 2^3 ] + [ ( 1 ) × 2^2 ] + [ ( 0 ) × 2^1 ] + [ ( 1 ) × 2^0 ] $$

That is - __37__
