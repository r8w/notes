Takeaway from the [original post.](https://medium.com/s/story/how-to-be-polite-9bf1e69e888c)



- Politeness is not limited to thanking and greeting. It's more than that.

- When you're required to have a conversation in a given situation for whatever reason, or you're having a conversation in general, take as much as time you could before you ask about what they do. It tests your limit regarding how far you can stretch the conversation, but it doesn't mean you should make it boring.

- While talking, ask what they do, and when they tell about their job, tell them "wow, that sounds difficult" because everyone thinks that their job is difficult, so they'll spend more time talking about it.

- The other way to be polite is to avoid touching people unless they invite you to. Later, the writer talks about touching people's hair and prostitutes and people taking a shit in someone's bathroom.


I found the post total nonsensical, yet if you read the comment, someone mentioned that it's one of the best posts they've ever read. I was continuously yawning while reading the post, as I had no idea what and how it had to do with politeness.
